# {nottshcData} package

This is a presentation by Milan Wiedemann delivered at the joint NHS-R Community and Pycom [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glz6xj7HKnE).

The talk introduces the {nottshcData} package that is currently being built and used in Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust for querying, tidying and analysing in R with data from SQL databases.

Slides were originally created using Google Slides and then downloaded as a PowerPoint to retain the presenter notes and to be available to copy text/images but also available as a pdf to retain formatting.
