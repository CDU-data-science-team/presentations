# What this talk will NOT cover...

How to set up an account

not that much about version control either

it's not going to be all that technical...

# What is GitHub?

### "The code is on my Github repo"

# Who uses this (or should do)

* Analysts
* Data Scientists
* Academics
* [Teams](https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team)
* [Organisations](https://github.com/nhs-r-community)

# What does not go into it (or shouldn't do)?

* Large files
* Passwords
* Outputs (sometimes)
* Anything patient identifiable

# Looking for something?

# Searching GitHub

### By user/organisation

On an account repositories can be searched here:

]

# Searching GitHub

### Global search

.b--black.ba.bw1.br2.shadow-5.ph4.mt3[

---

### Search for NHS Number

Prompts to define by the user/organisation or in the whole of GitHub

.b--black.ba.bw1.br2.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
![Image of search of the words NHS Number](img/search-nhsnumber.PNG)
]

class: inverse-white

### And this is what you get

.b--black.ba.bw1.br2.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
![Screenshot of NHS Number search in all GitHub](img/all-github-nhsnumber.PNG)
]

---
class: inverse-white

## Like all searches...

Beware of spaces. 

"NHS Number" gets 2 repositories for R but "NHSNumber" with no space gets 3 different and perhaps more useful repos
