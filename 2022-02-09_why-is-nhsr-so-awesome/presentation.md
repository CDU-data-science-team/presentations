## Introduction

* I learned R in 2009 in the bad old days
* I swore that I’d make sure that others didn’t suffer like I did
* NHS-R is the fulfilment of this promise

## Core values of open source

* Transparency
* Collaboration
* Release early and often
* Inclusive meritocracy
* Community
* Work across organisational boundaries (obviously)

## Core values

* Flat hierarchy
* Sharing
* Cooperate across organisational boundaries
* We cooperate across international boundaries
* We love beginners
* We make mistakes and learn together

## What is NHS-R?

* Culture > Strategy
* Doing > Talking
* NHS-R is your permission to work your way
* Nobody ever asks us to do our best work
    * NHSRplotthedots
* We know what to build, we know what to learn
* “Computer (department) says no”

## What's the recipe?

* Senior fellows:
    * Statistics
    * Machine learning
    * Academia
    * Open source
    * Teaching
* Community driven

## Open source

* We believe in open source
* All NHS R solutions are open source
* We teach git and GitHub and encourage organisations to share their code
* We build stuff together because we believe in the value of the community

## The best things in life are free...?

## But you can keep them for the birds and bees...?

* Admin support - cost £££

## The cost of everything...

* You can't buy a community
* But you can and must buy the glue that binds them together

## Force multiplier

* Code is a force multiplier
* Wickham, 2014 https://bit.ly/3jQ5SuJ
* So is a community
* NHS-R is absurdly cheap and its ROI is absurdly high
* NHS-R is making people happy and productive
* NHS-R is changing the lives of its members and improving healthcare for everyone in the UK
