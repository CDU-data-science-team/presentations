## Introduction

* I learned R in 2009 in the bad old days
* I swore that I’d make sure that others didn’t suffer like I did
* NHS-R is the fulfilment of this promise

## Core values

* Flat hierarchy
* Sharing
* Cooperate across organisational boundaries
* We cooperate across international boundaries
* We love beginners
* We make mistakes and learn together

## Core values of open source

* Transparency
* Collaboration
* Release early and often
* Inclusive meritocracy
* Community
* Work across organisational boundaries (obviously)

## What is NHS-R?

* Culture > Strategy
* Doing > Talking
* NHS-R is your permission to work your way
* Nobody ever asks us to do our best work
    * NHSRplotthedots
* We know what to build, we know what to learn
* “Computer (department) says no”

## What's the recipe?
