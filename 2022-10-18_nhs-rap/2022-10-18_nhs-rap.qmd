## Summary

* Your experience with RAP in your own team and organisation
* The key issues in delivering training to NHS and care staff and how these might be overcome
* Your reflections on the components of an effective journey to RAP and what this mean for this role

## What is RAP?

* Same data, same results

## What is the ultimate form of RAP?

* RAP is used to maximise transparency
    * Analyses are shared (rerunnable) freely where possible within the organisation
    * Analytic code is *all* shared outside the organisation
* RAP is used to drive analytic standards

## What is the ultimate form of RAP?

* Culture change
    * Desire for transparency to make sure analysis is right
    * ["Nullius in verba"](https://royalsociety.org/about-us/history/)
* RAP is a whole region approach
    * Concerted collaboration between ICS/ DSN members who speak common "language"
    * Inter org code reviews
    * Whole system methodologies wRAPped and used across orgs (e.g. demographic characteristics of a population)

## Key issues in training

* Making sure the materials are accessIble *and* accessAble
    * Open licence
* Experiential learning
  * Cooperation- DSN/ NHS-R

## Key issues in training

* Making it useful
    * RAP is *not* just for big returns of data
    * [Is it worth the time?](https://xkcd.com/1205/)
    * Reuse regionally and nationally

## My experience of RAP

* [I have been promoting RAP in my Trust for 10 years](https://chrisbeeley.net/?p=1660)
* My entire journey with R was based on RAP
* My team is a leading practitioner of RAP across the NHS
    * Version control
    * Common tools for data access
    * Documentation and documented functions

## Components of an effective journey to RAP and what it means for the role

* What happens to the non-RAP tools?
    * They complement, but do not replace, RAP compliant methodology
* What happens to staff who can't do it?
    * These people do not exist
    * If they do exist, which they don't, they can work on the performance management/ stakeholder engagement/ comms/ monitoring side, with RAP compliant tools placed in their hands
    
## Components of an effective journey to RAP and what it means for the role

* Selling the approach
  * The wins are quick
  * Better trained and retained staff
  * More accurate and more interesting analyses
* Where are the blockers?
  * In the middle
