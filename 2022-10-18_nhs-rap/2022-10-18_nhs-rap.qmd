## Summary

It should cover:

* Your vision for RAP for NHS and care staff
* Your experience with RAP in your own team and organisation
* The key issues in delivering training to NHS and care staff and how these might be overcome
* Your reflections on the components of an effective journey to RAP and what this mean for this role -->

## What is RAP?

* Same data, same results

## What is my vision for RAP in health and care?

* RAP is a whole organisation approach
    * RAP procurement of proprietary PHRs
    * RAP procurement of analytic software
    * Data is represented in code

## What is the ultimate form of RAP?

* RAP is used to maximise transparency
    * Analyses are shared freely where possible within the organisation
    * Analytic code is *all* shared outside the organisation
* RAP is used to drive analytic standards
    * Someone expert in analysis can rapidly review analytic pipelines and consider where they're appropriate for further analysis
* Renv, CI/ CD
* Esteem of data engineering
    * Not just running a database, making it *work*
    * Data engineering is done to fulfil the analytics objectives of the organisation
* There are no SPOFs, and no hero coders
    * Every line of code is tested and reviewed, and every line of code is understood by 2+ people
    
## What is the ultimate form of RAP?

* Culture change
    * Desire for transparency to make sure analysis is right
    * Distrust of black box results at any stage of the pipeline
* RAP is a whole region approach
    * Concerted collaboration between ICS members who speak common "language"
    * Inter org code reviews
    * Whole system methodologies wRAPped and used across orgs (e.g. demographic characteristics of a population)

# The key issues in delivering training to NHS and care staff and how these might be overcome

## Key issues in training

* Getting the right people in the door
    * Who is doing RAP and why
* Making sure the materials are accessIble *and* accessAble
    * Open licence
* WAGOLL
* WAGEOLL
* What is RAP? 
    * Is it data science?
    * Is it data engineering?
    * Is it something entirely new?

## Key issues in training

* Making it useful
    * RAP is *not* just for big returns of data
    * [Is it worth the time?](https://xkcd.com/1205/)

## Key issues in training

* What are the components of RAP training?
    * What language should it be in?
    * Core components:
        * Intro to programming
        * Version control
    * Add ons
        * Reporting and deployment
        * CI/ CD
        
## My experience of RAP

* [I have been promoting RAP in my Trust for 10 years](https://chrisbeeley.net/?p=1660)
* My entire journey with R was based on RAP
* My team is a leading practitioner of RAP across the NHS
    * Version control
    * Common tools for data access
    * Documentation and documented functions

## Components of an effective journey to RAP and what it means for the role

* What happens to the non-RAP tools?
    * They complement, but do not replace, RAP compliant methodology
* What happens to staff who can't do it?
    * These people do not exist
    * If they do exist, which they don't, they can work on the performance management/ stakeholder engagement/ comms/ monitoring side, with RAP compliant tools placed in their hands
    
## Components of an effective journey to RAP and what it means for the role

* "T- shaped" staff
    * Data engineers who understand analytics
    * Data scientists who understand data engineering
* RAP is done by teams, not by individuals
  * Some teams will be small, especially at first
* Selling the approach
  * The wins are quick
  * Better trained and maintained staff
  * 
* Selling delays and mishaps
  * *Think* about IG
* Selling openness
