# What is RAP?

How many have heard of Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP)?

# A story in Chrome tabs

Guess how many tabs I have open in a "folder" called RAP?

# Quoting the Government Analytical Function

> Reproducibility is the cornerstone of analysis. Analysts should get the same results as each other when using the same data and methods.

--

This is the very first line of the [foreword](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-strategy/) from the Head of the Analysis Function and National Statistician Prof Sir Ian Diamond.

# Reproducible...

## research

> Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.

[Coursera Reproducible Research course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research)

--

## analytical pipelines

> ... produce high quality, shared, reviewable, re-usable, well-documented code for data curation and analysis; minimise inefficient duplication; avoid unverifiable ‘black box’ analyses; and make each new analysis faster.

# Breaking it down

![Girl with wooden blocks which are rounded in overall shape but have straight sides](img/pexels-artem-podrez-6951915.jpg)

---

# Building blocks

-	automate every step of analysis

--

-	have open code (publicly where possible and at the least within the team)

--

-	use version control

--

-	commented and documented code

# Acknowledgments

Acknowledgements: the professional look of this presentation, using NHS and Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust colour branding, exists because of the amazing work of Silvia Canelón, details of the workshops she ran at the [NHS-R Community conference](https://spcanelon.github.io/xaringan-basics-and-beyond/index.html), Milan Wiedemann who created the CDU Data Science logo with the help of the team and Zoë Turner for putting together the slides.
