# NHS Wales Modelling Collaborative: Peer Support Session

I was invited to talk at the NHS Wales Modelling Collaborative on behalf of NHS-R Community and as this is a peer review session, share some work that may be of interest to analysts. I chose to talk about using RMarkdown for blogs like those I created for the CDU Data Science Team, as well as a few examples of my own Hugo Apéro sites, as these have not only honed my RMarkdown skills and offered a space for creativity, they all support the CDU Data Science Team's objectives of openness and sharing.

The presentation was built in {xaringan} and can be viewed https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/presentations/2021-08-03%20Using%20RMarkdown%20for%20blogs/Using-RMarkdown-for-blogs.html#1 as published through GitHub.

The event was virtual and was held on 3 August 2021.
