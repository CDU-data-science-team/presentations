# How I started

### NHS-R Community Training

When NHS-R Community 'started' I was told:

--

If you use more code than text use a script

--

If you write more text than code use RMarkdown

--

# Soon changed to...

Use RMarkdown all the time

  for coding and reports

# RMarkdown can be used for

 - presentation slides (interactive xaringanExtra::scribble())
 - blogs
 - [training](https://nhs-r-community.github.io/intro_r/) 
 - [interactive apps](https://regionh.shinyapps.io/hais/) (like Shiny called Flexdashboards)

# RMarkdown is not just R

Crucially, and I never realised this even when using them, it combines languages. I've used:

 * R
 * SQL
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * Markup Language
 * Markdown

# Which leads me to blogs

## Why blog?

Started with submitting blogs to [NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/authors/) amongst other established blogging NHS analysts

* some technical
* some wordy

# You should have your own website

# Benefits of distill

* Pages can be published free through GitHub
* Comprehensive support pages from [RStudio](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/)
* Easy to see how others have created pages as code is open and shared
* Clean layout that is a standard for scientific writing

# Benefits of Hugo Apéro 

* Incredibly flexible and can be much more than a blog site
* The [template](https://github.com/hugo-apero/hugo-apero) is a nice way of setting up a site with minimal effort
* Also easy to see how others have created pages as code is open and shared
* Can be hosted free through services like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
