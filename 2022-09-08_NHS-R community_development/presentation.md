% NHS-R community: Supporting users and publishing open source in UK health and social care.
% Chris Beeley, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust
% 8th September 2022

## What is NHS-R?

* Analysts and data scientists in health and social care
* Using open source tools (mainly R!)
* We share code (everything defaults to OPEN)
* Cooperate across organisational boundaries
* We cooperate across international boundaries
* We love beginners
* We make mistakes and learn together

## Why does NHS-R exist?

* Training
* Community
* Policy/ good practice
* Building tools for everyone to use- WAGOLL
* Lead by example- share, be inclusive, and be attractive to beginners

## Open source

* Natural to assume that the NHS is a collaborative enterprise
* Until recently there were no mechanisms to help us cooperate at all
* Everything is done over and over again, duplicatively, on proprietary DBs
* In the recent past:
    * No incentive to share
    * Many barriers to sharing

## Who does share? 

* [Facebook](https://engineering.fb.com/2020/01/13/open-source/open-source-2019/)
* [Microsoft](https://opensource.microsoft.com/projects/)
* [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/opensource/)
* [Samsung](https://opensource.samsung.com/main)

## Let's talk about Prophet

* What is Prophet?
* Why did Facebook give away Prophet (MIT licence)?
* I really have no idea, but letâ€™s speculate anyway
    * Developers like to work in the open so it helps with recruitment and retention
    * They want people to use it so they can get better suggestions about how to improve it
    * They want people to improve it by submitting pull requests (several at the time of writing)
    * They donâ€™t want the hassle of selling it!

## Why would we share?

* The four freedoms
    * Use
    * Study
    * Share
    * Improve

## How are we doing?

* Some orgs are still fighting about use!
* Many fighting tooth and nail over learning and transparency
    * Why?
* Building? Largely a pipe dream
    * Why?
* Contributing? No! 
    * Why? *The Daily Mail test*

## What can NHS-R do about this?

* Permission
* Visibility and community
* Skills
    * Basic- git, GitHub, issues, pull requests...
    * Advanced- building reusable stuff is hard
    * Advanced advanced- building reusable stuff *together* is really hard!

## Building tools

* Two tools today
* One for every provider trust in the country- simple, RAP compliant, useful
* One to show the potential for open source data science

## NHSRplotthedots

* SPCs and [Making Data Count](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/making-data-count/)
* Done up and down the country with Excel templates
    * Not RAP compliant
    * ... what is RAP?
* We discussed the idea of an R implementation of this for a long time
* In the end someone just got on with it
* Someone from the community shared code they'd already written
* Group effort to expand and improve
* Now on CRAN with >1500 downloads

## Community roles

* Methodology
* Documentation
* User requirements and testing
* Code and repo management
* Wider community engagement

## Why it succeeded

* Real business need
* Grew organically from users deploying the package
* Community roles
* CRAN package == Good for security departments in NHS
* Promoted by MDC
* User engagement, teamwork
    * A truly collaborative, high quality product
    * Funding: Â£0

## Text mining of patient experience data

* One year funded project (NHSE)
* Now funded for another year
* NHS-R funded an R wrapper to the Python code in the project
* Python code, Shiny dashboard
    * Ship the code as MIT and do a managed deployment on RStudio Connect

## Success!?

* The code works and the evaluation was a success
* There is a real and growing need for text analytics in healthcare
    * DMs open ðŸ˜‰ 
* Judged by my own standards the project is not a success (yet!)
    * Nobody outside the team has ever contributed to the code
    * Nobody outside the team has even run the code

## What are the barriers

* Code is complex
    * The whole pipeline is in two languages
* Many of the pilot sites are locked into contracts with other providers
    * Including collection and collation
* BI systems are not usually in R
    * (even ours aren't- except patient experience because I wrote it)
* It's too cheap!

## What can we do? 

* Build tools, not pipelines
    * Do one thing well
* Start charging for open source (?!)
* Get in the weeds and deploy it trust by trust (?!)
* Listen to users and developers

## Summary

* Open source means efficiency, transparency, and building the stuff we *actually want*
* Open source is hard. Using the tools is hard and writing the code is hard
* Having permission to share (never mind about collaboratively build) is hard
* NHS-R exists to give people the permission, skills, and sense of belonging necessary to build software together

## The projects

* NHSRplothedots is a testament to the power of community
    * Does one thing, everybody wants it, easy to deploy, created spontaneously
    * WAGOLL
* Text mining is a problem to be solved
    * I want to ship the code
    * I want others to contribute
    * I want someone else to host it, even
* Can we build bigger than NHSRplotthedots?
* Can we build smaller than patient experience text mining?

Abstract:

The NHS-R community exists to help and support users of open source data science tools in UK health and care organisations, as well as to encourage the production, spread, and adoption of tools built with those methods. This talk will describe two projects which were supported by NHS-R, an open source text mining algorithm which allows users of patient experience data to rapidly classify thousands of comments according to their theme and positivity/ negativity, and a project which developed the first RAP compliant implementation of NHS England's statistical process control (SPC) methodology which is a key part of reporting at many NHS provider trusts. This talk will summarise the methodology and technology behind each as well as showing the specific ways in which they were supported by the community. The text mining work is productionised within a Shiny Golem dashboard and runs Python code through reticulate- further work was carried out to produce an R wrapper of the Python code to make it easy for R programmers to use the model themselves.
