# Introduction

* A history of Shiny
* What does Shiny do well? 
* What does Shiny not do well?
* How can we combine Shiny with other tools to improve our applications?

---

# Shiny - a history

* This is my personal recollection. YMMV
* In the early days it was really more suitable for exploring your own data
* Lacked good documentation, modules and many important functions
* Lots of self taught programmers writing applications with little good practice guidance
* With predictable consequences `r emo::ji("upside_down_face")`

---

# When all you have is a hammer...

* (everything looks like a nail)
* If you only know Excel...
    * You end up writing complex fragile models in it
* If you're a data scientist that only knows Shiny for interaction...
    * You end up writing all of your interactive code in R

---

# Data science is a team sport

* Very often we see data scientists building Shiny applications of their own models
* This is fine for testing, not so fine for production
* The world needs Shiny developers

---

# What are the skills of a Shiny developer?

* (some of...)
    * R/ Shiny `r emo::ji("wink")`
    * DevOps, deployment, {pins}, {targets}...
    * Web development, JavaScript, accessibility, visualisation
    * Working with modules and working with codebases written by others
    * Using internal packages for data processing and analysis
        * This code could be in R or Python 

---

# The context

* The NHS collects a lot of patient experience data
* Rate the service 1-5 (Very poor... Excellent) but also give written feedback
    * "Parking was difficult"
    * "Doctor was rude"
    * "You saved my life"
* Many organisations lack the staffing to read all of the feedback in a systematic way
* We have built an algorithm to read it
    * Theme
    * "Criticality"

---

# Patient experience 101

* Tick box scoring is not useful (or accurate)
* Text based data is _complex_ and built on _human experience_
* We're not making word clouds!
* We're not classifying movie reviews or Reddit posts
* The tool should enhance, not replace, human understanding
* "A recommendation engine for feedback data"

---

class: hide-logo

# The work

* We have had a year of funding to build a text classification model for patient feedback
* We now have another year of funding to make it better, especially the frontend
* The model itself is written in Python
* Marked up and classified text data is a very rich source of data
* We need to build quite a sophisticated user interface to get the best out of this data

---

# The challenge

* We need...
* Performant, powerful, state of the art text mining and ML
* A highly interactive user interface which maximises the information we give to the user and maximises the information we collect from the enduser
* I think it's probably fair to say that R/ Shiny is not particularly good at either

# Python! Huh! What is it good for?

* Absolutely machine learning!
* The project makes (or will make) free use of loads of Python packages, including:
  * Scikit-learn
  * Gensim
  * Text blob
  * Spacy
  * Vader
* Python ML is fast and multicore out of the box

---

# Well how do you do it?

* [Demo time!](https://involve.nottshc.nhs.uk/rsconnect/jane_eyre/)

---

# So how _do_ you do it?

* With {reticulate} (natch)
* With functions
* That's it!

```{python, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

from textblob import TextBlob

def sentiment(text):
  text_blob = TextBlob(text)
  return(text_blob.sentiment.polarity)

```

---

# And over in your Shiny application...

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

# load functions
reticulate::source_python("python_code.py") 

output$histogram <- renderPlot({
  
  sentiment_score <- purrr::map_dbl(selected_text(), function(x){
    sentiment(x)
  })
  
  df_graph <- data.frame("sentiment" = sentiment_score)
  
  df_graph |>
    ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(sentiment)) +
    ggplot2::geom_histogram() + ggplot2::xlim(-1, 1)
})

```

# Wait, there's more...

* [You can import Python packages directly and call them from R](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/#importing-python-modules)
* [You can run Python scripts as files or directly as quoted code and access the objects they create as R objects](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/calling_python.html#executing-code)
* [You can build an R wrapper to your Python code and just call that directly](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/package.html)

---

# And now to JavaScript

* Every time we interact with a Shiny application we hit the server
* There are lots of ways of limiting and otherwise handling our interactions with the server
    * Reactive functions
    * Caching outputs and other intermediate steps
    * Throttling, debouncing
    * ... you're at a Shiny conference. You know a lot of this
    
---

# There is another way

* What if we could get the user's computer to do some work?
* It's probably pretty much idle while they're using our app, so let's borrow the CPU to do some stuff for them
    * Not crypto mining (that's another talk!)
    * We can run JavaScript in the browser
* There is lots of JavaScript packaged up for R
    * The DT package uses JavaScript
    * {shinyjs} has LOADS of useful JavaScript in it

---

# All your JavaScript are belong to us

* You can take it further without really too much effort
    * You can use JavaScript packages
    * You can write your own JavaScript
* [Demo time!](https://involve.nottshc.nhs.uk/rsconnect/jane_eyre/)

---

# Golem to the rescue!

* Golem even makes this easy

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

golem::add_js_file("heart")
golem::add_css_file("heart")

```

---

# My heart will go in inst/

* JavaScript and any modules that are called go in inst/app/www
* Any files the browser needs like graphics go in there too
    * (and are referred to in code just as "www/filename.png")

---

# Why are we doing this again?

* There are non silly applications of this kind of work
* We can mark up and highlight text in complex ways
    * We can mark negative sentences
    * We can mark words on a theme (care words, staff words, emotional words...)
    * We can use a huge range of JavaScript output widgets to make interesting visualisations
    * Devise methods of collecting data from the user
        * _That_ sentence is about *this*, _this_ sentence is about *that*
