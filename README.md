# Presentations from the Clinical Development Unit Data Science Team

## Information

Each folder in this repository contains the presentation and corresponding images or documents. Every folder will contain its own README with information on the presentation.

## Formats

Where possible, presentations will be built from the [xaringan presentation template](https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team/presentation-template) and rendered in html formats to allow for accessibility. Templates can be used directly from the team's [repository](https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team/presentation-template) or via installation of the package [{nottshcMethods}](https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team/nottshcMethods):

```
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("CDU-data-science-team/nottshcMethods")
```

Where presentations have been produced in Powerpoint these will be made available in pdf formats.

## Folder naming

The convention will be to put the presentation date followed by the presentation name, for example:

<kbd> 2021-05-14 My Presentation </kbd>

## Really useful links

If a presentation is referred to elsewhere details should be put here for easier reference to update if necessary:
