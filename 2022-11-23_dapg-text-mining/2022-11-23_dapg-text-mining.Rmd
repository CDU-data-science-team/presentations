# Unsupervised methods ("Topic modelling")

* Surveys and consultations
* Topic discovery (incl. informing supervised work)
* Simple and attractive methods like Top2Vec

---

# Supervised methods

* Classifying patient experience data
* Classifying incident data (ongoing work here)
* Extracting diagnosis, pharmacy information, etc.
  
---

# Early work

* [Unsupervised learning](https://github.com/ChrisBeeley/naturallanguageprocessing)
  * [More here from NHSX](https://github.com/nhsx/stm-survey-text)
* Some early success with supervised learning led to...
* Funded one year project (NHSE insight and feedback team)

---

# Principles of the work

* Free and open source
  * The four freedoms:
  * Use, study, modify, distribute
* Use it today if you want to
* We are also building a frontend and hosting in the cloud
  * Â£

---

# Year 1

* [Classification algorithm in Python](https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team/pxtextmining)
  * Classifies "theme" and "criticality"
  * c. 75% and 60% accurate
  * Fits lots of models and feature sets
  * [Available as an R package](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/pxtextmineR)
* [Dashboard](https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team/experiencesdashboard) is less well developed but is proof of concept
  * [Demo](https://feedbackmatters.uk/rsconnect/experience_a/)

# External and internal evaluation

* First year project was successful because:
  * Free and open source
  * Effective and easy to use code
  * Designed alongside healthcare staff
* Areas for improvement
  * Multi label tagging
  * "Sentiment"
  * More detail in the theme categories
  
---

# The future

* New theme categories
* New data, relabelled
* Streamlined code
* Better accuracy
* Multi label
* Better dashboard
* Professionally hosted dashboard
